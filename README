These files originally came from the usfm_rev1 usfm, then from usfm_rev2 usfm.

For usfm_rev2:
They had a handful of \qt...\qt* problems that Matt Postiff fixed in Bibledit.
I highlighted the problems in an email to Elizabeth Wheeler on 10/11/2018.
Bibledit exported fine, but one difference was notable compared to the original
USFM files: the \rq...\rq* marker was put on its own line. This caused, for example
50 trivial whitespace differences between the rev1 Matthew usfm and the rev2 usfm.

For usfm_rev3:
They had diamond markers in them to indicate glossary words. These marks
had to be removed before publication in the Android app.

The diamond marker is encoded as 0xe2 99 a6.
The following command was used to remove these characters:
replace 's/\xe2\x99\xa6//g' test.txt

As a check I did this:

ls -l *.usfm | ~/scripts/sumcol 5
   (These are the new, diamond-less files.)
Sum: 2282308

ls -l *.usfm.bak | ~/scripts/sumcol 5
   (These are the original files.)
Sum: 2282959

The difference should be evenly divisible by three, since I removed 3
bytes per occurrence.

The difference is 651, which when divided by 3 = 217. That's how many
diamond markers were removed.
